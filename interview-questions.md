# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a javascript extension for react. And one syntax differnce between HTML and JSX is class and className. 

Researched answer: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, primarily used in React to define the structure and appearance of user interface components. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is that you use className instead of class in JSX for defining CSS classes. This is because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and JSX needs to be transformed into valid JavaScript.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager you can add or run on your local device. 

Researched answer: Yarn is indeed a package manager, used to manage dependencies in a project. When you run the yarn command in the terminal, it fetches and installs packages defined in the package.json file.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values and props are both used in React, but state values are used to store or "state" data in one file or component. While props can pass data on to other components. 

Researched answer: 

State values are used to store and manage data within a component. They are mutable and can be changed within the component. State is typically used for data that can change over time, and when state is updated, it triggers a re-render of the component to reflect the new data.

Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component that receives them. They are used to pass data from higher-level components down the component tree, making it easy to share data between components.

4. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Researched answer: A div tag serves as an divider in the page, across the entire page. While a span tag only spans the element or word specified; not the entire page.
